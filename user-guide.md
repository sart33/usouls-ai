# USouls AI — User Guide

## 1. General Information

When you launch the app for the first time, you will see a welcome screen.

---

## 2. API Keys Setup

Go to:  
**Settings → API Keys**

You need to enter two keys:

### • DeepSeek API (required for chat)
https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys  

Minimum deposit: $2.  
If you set a response limit, this can last for a fairly long time.

### • Novita AI (for image generation)
https://novita.ai/dashboard/api-keys  

Minimum deposit: $10.  
One image costs about half a cent, so this is enough for a large number of generations.

After entering:
- Chat API → chat becomes available  
- Image API → image generation is unlocked  

**API keys are stored only on your device.**

---

## 3. Quick Setup

### Chat Text Size

After entering API keys, you can go to settings and choose a comfortable chat font size.

---

## 4. Characters

### 4.1 Default Characters

Go back to the main screen and open the character panel.  
You will see two pre-generated characters — **Anya** and **Natasha**.

They differ in appearance and behavior.

- 👁 Eye icon → open character profile  
- 📷 Camera icon → generate an image  

The profile contains:
- character description  
- greeting message  

---

### 4.2 Editing and Creating Characters

Press **Edit** to modify:
- description  
- appearance  
- behavior  

It is recommended to define a consistent character with personality and motivation — this improves response quality and stability.

---

### 4.3 Appearance Description Guidelines

You can write the character description in **any language**.

However, the following attributes are **recommended to be written in English**:
- ethnicity (Caucasian, Asian, Latina, Black, Middle Eastern, etc.)  
- hair color (blonde, brunette, redhead, black hair, etc.)  
- skin tone (fair skin, tan skin, dark skin, olive skin, etc.)  

This reduces unexpected results during image generation, especially for avatars.

---

### 4.4 Saving and Deleting

After editing, press **Save**.

For about **10 seconds**, prompts and generation styles are being updated.  
Avoid generating images during this time.

On mobile, you can also crop and adjust the avatar.

**Delete Character** removes:
- the character  
- all images  
- all chat branches  

A confirmation dialog will appear before deletion.

---

### 4.5 Creating a New Character

To create a new character:
- enter a name  
- add a description (you can use default examples)  
- define behavior (default can also be used as a base)

---

### 4.6 Avatar Generation

If you create a new character or open the edit screen of an existing one, you can generate an avatar for it. To do this, click the **"Generate"** button.

After that, a modal window will appear:
- in the desktop version — a centered modal window
- in the mobile version — a bottom sheet modal

Inside, you can choose an avatar style:

- **Evening Elegance**
- **Summer Walk**
- **Office Style**
- **Lingerie Mood**
- **Beach Bikini**
- **Silk Morning**

Select one of the available styles.

If you choose any style, the prompt is generated first, then the image itself is created.

### After Generation

**Mobile version:**
- Tap **"Crop and save"** (grid icon) to adjust scale and framing
- Avatar regeneration is also available — you can regenerate the image in the same style or choose a different one

**Desktop version:**
- You can regenerate the avatar in the selected style (e.g., *Evening Elegance*) — each generation will slightly change the outfit and environment
- You can also click **"Generate"** again and select a different style, then save or regenerate again

You can also select any image from your device gallery.

---

## 5. Multi-Chat

In the **Multi-chat** section, you will see two default characters — Natasha and Anya.  
You can start chatting immediately.

Each character responds independently.

- Tap character icon → open their gallery  
- Use **Edit** to:
  - add characters  
  - change behavior  
  - edit greeting  

### Recommendations:
- Optimal: **2–4 characters**  
- Maximum: **up to 5**  

More may result in overly long responses or confusion.

---

## 6. Chat Usage

Click a character to open their chat list.  
If no chat exists — create a new one.

---

### 6.1 General Flow

After sending a message:
- response time: **2–30 seconds**  
- multi-chat may take longer  

---

### 6.2 Controlling Responses

You can specify desired response length.

Buttons:

- **Continue** → continues the scene  
- **More Details** → enables detailed mode (actions, emotions, reactions of all participants)

---

### 6.3 Image Generation

In single-character chats, there is a **Photo** button.

It generates an image based on:
- current scene  
- pose  
- clothing  
- mood  

You can regenerate the result.

---

### 6.4 Message Editing

Long press on a message:
- edit  
- delete  
- copy  

After editing or deleting, the conversation continues from that point.

---

### 6.5 Voice Input (Android)

Voice input via keyboard is recommended.

The model generally understands context well, but it’s better to review the text before sending.

---

### 6.6 Image Storage

All generated images:
- are stored inside the app  
- do **not** appear in the device gallery

---

## 7. Advanced Settings (Fine Tuning)

### • Creativity (temperature)

- ~0.7 → stable character behavior  
- 1.2–1.5 → more creative, but possible personality drift

---

### • Personality Reminder

Recommended to enable.  
Optimal frequency: **about 1 in 10 messages**

---

### • Long Chat Summarization

Allows the character to retain memory in long conversations.

Recommended if you plan long-term interaction.

The longer the interaction, the higher the limit can be set.

**Clear All Summaries** affects all characters.

---

### • Auto-delete Chat Images

Applies only to images generated inside chats.  
Does not affect character gallery.

Range:
- 7 to 60 days

---

### • AI Response Limit

Controls the maximum length of AI responses (in tokens).

Recommended ranges:

- **100–200 tokens** → minimal cost, short but still expressive replies  
- **300–800 tokens** → balanced mode for regular roleplay  
- **1000–2000 tokens** → long, detailed responses  

Higher values significantly increase cost and are usually unnecessary.

In multi-character chats, the total usage scales with the number of characters, so using very high limits may result in excessive token consumption.

---

### • User Input Limit

Can be left unchanged — not critical for typical usage.
